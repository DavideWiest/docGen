# Starter App in Blazor

This project exists primarily to provide developers looking to start a new Blazor project with a useful and exemplary starting point. 

## Why
## Why

This project was created to in an effort to make new Blazor Apps faster and simpler to setup. 
New projects often have some boilerplate, even with Blazor. Furthermore, I didn't want a project to inlcude bootstrap automatically. (I opted for tailwindcss instead.)

The docGen repository is a framework to get started with the actual development phase earlier, and avoid repetition.

## Getting Started
## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
`git clone https://github.com/CodingWithDavid/docGen`
`cd docGen`

2. Open in Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code
With Visual Studio Code you will need to install the C# extensions:

3. Install the required packages as documented in `docGen.csproj`
Use `dotnet restore` or install them manually

4. Replace all text and filename occurences of `docGen` with your actual projectname

5. Customize project-specific-colors in `static/js/twConfig.js`

6. Replace sample credentials in `static/content/credentials.json` 
This information is required by law in many countries, and the EU, which is why I included it in here.

6. Switch out the basis-legal-texts with your own ones or remove them.

- static content is located in `static`, not `wwwroot`
- Account-related components such as a login-page belong to `identity` (which exists in both frontend-folders)
- Frequently used components are stored in `Shared/base`, seperated into subfolders for each respective group
- Important constants, and "magic"-values are stored in the `Constants` class
